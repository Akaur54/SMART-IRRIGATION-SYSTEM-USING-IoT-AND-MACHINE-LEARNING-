# 🌱 Smart Irrigation System using IoT and Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Irrigation System** is designed to optimize water usage in agriculture using IoT sensors and Machine Learning. By collecting real-time soil moisture data and weather conditions, the system predicts irrigation schedules and automates water distribution, reducing wastage and improving crop yields.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Traditional irrigation methods cause **water wastage and improper crop hydration**. Farmers struggle to determine the correct water levels due to unpredictable weather patterns, leading to **low yields and high costs**. Our system addresses these challenges through **real-time monitoring and predictive analytics**.

## 🎯 Objective
- Utilize **IoT sensors** to collect soil moisture data in real time.
- Implement a **Random Forest Machine Learning Model** to predict crop water requirements.
- Provide a **user-friendly interface** for farmers to **remotely monitor and control** irrigation.
- Reduce water wastage and improve **crop productivity**.

## 🛠️ Methodology
### **1️⃣ Data Collection**
- Soil moisture sensors collect data.
- Weather API retrieves real-time weather conditions.

### **2️⃣ System Design**
- IoT components integrated with **Arduino**.
- A control system manages the irrigation pump.

### **3️⃣ Machine Learning Implementation**
- **Random Forest Model** trained to predict irrigation schedules.
